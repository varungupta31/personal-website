I'm a research fellow at the [Center for Visual Infromation Technology (CVIT)](https://cvit.iiit.ac.in/) at IIIT Hyderabad. I work with [Prof. C.V. Jawahar](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~jawahar/), [Dr. Anbumani Subramanian](https://in.linkedin.com/in/anbumanisubramanian), [Dr. Ravi Kiran S.](https://ravika.github.io/) and [Dr. Rohit Saluja](https://in.linkedin.com/in/dr-rohit-saluja-b2087529). My research interest lies in Computer Vision, and I am currently associated with the [Mobility Group](https://inai.iiit.ac.in/domains/smart-mobility.html), where I'm exploring to enhance the road infrastructure for Autonomous Driving on unconstrained roads. Previously, I was a Research Intern at the [National Institute of Technology, Goa](https://www.nitgoa.ac.in/), where I worked with [Dr. Lalat Indu Giri](https://nitgoa.ac.in/emp_profile.aspx?nDeptID=156) on Contactless Monitoring of Respiratory Rate in Humans using Infrared Thermography. I completed my Bachelor's in Engineering (Information Technology), from Manipal University Jaipur in 2021. 

There's a book and a song, for every situation and mood. Besides my academic interests, I spend my time cooking, biking, playing bass, capturing stills and picking up some weights!
