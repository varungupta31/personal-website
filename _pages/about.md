I'm a Masters (CSE) student at the [Center for Visual Infromation Technology (CVIT)](https://cvit.iiit.ac.in/) at [IIIT Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/), working on video-understanding and representation learning. I'm advised by [Dr. Makarand Tapaswi](https://makarandtapaswi.github.io/) and [Prof. C.V. Jawahar](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~jawahar/). Previously, I interned as a research-fellow within the Mobility Group at  CVIT, with Prof. C.V. Jawahar, [Dr. Anbumani Subramanian](https://in.linkedin.com/in/anbumanisubramanian) and [Dr. Rohit Saluja](https://scee.iitmandi.ac.in/faculty_personal.php?id=22), where I worked on enhancing the road infrastructure for Autonomous Driving on unconstrained roads. During my undergrad, I interned at the [National Institute of Technology, Goa](https://www.nitgoa.ac.in/), where I worked with [Dr. Lalat Indu Giri](https://www.nitgoa.ac.in/People/frontend/lalat.html) on Contactless Monitoring of Respiratory Rate in Humans using Infrared Thermography.

Besides my academic interests, I enjoy cooking, biking, playing bass, capturing stills and picking up some weights!
