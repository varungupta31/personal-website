I'm a Masters (CSE) student at the [Center for Visual Infromation Technology (CVIT)](https://cvit.iiit.ac.in/) at [IIIT Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/), where I'm exploring the long-range understanding of videos and representaion-learning. I'm advised by [Dr. Makarand Tapaswi](https://makarandtapaswi.github.io/) and [Prof. C.V. Jawahar](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~jawahar/). Previously, I interned as a research-fellow within the Mobility Group, at  CVIT with Prof. C.V. Jawahar, [Dr. Anbumani Subramanian](https://in.linkedin.com/in/anbumanisubramanian) and [Dr. Rohit Saluja](https://rohitsaluja22.github.io/), where I worked on enhancing the road infrastructure for Autonomous Driving on unconstrained roads. During my undergrad, I was interned at the [National Institute of Technology, Goa](https://www.nitgoa.ac.in/), where I worked with [Dr. Lalat Indu Giri](https://nitgoa.ac.in/emp_profile.aspx?nDeptID=156) on Contactless Monitoring of Respiratory Rate in Humans using Infrared Thermography. I completed my Bachelor's in Engineering (Information Technology), from Manipal University Jaipur in 2021. 

Besides my academic interests, I enjoy cooking, biking, playing bass, capturing stills and picking up some weights!
