      description:
        - Working on Identifying Missing Traffic Signs in Uncontrained roads.
        - Overseeing the annotations tasks for MTSVD (Missing Traffic Signs Video Dataset), the largest publicly accessible dataset for missing objects, and managing the annotation team.
        - Automated annotations by incorporating SORT-Tracker, fine tuned the tracks by writing a coordinate extrapolation script for missed frames, and prepared automated annotations in several formats like JSON, MS-COCO and CVAT-for-Video, for increasing annotation efficiency.
        - Exploring Attention modules, Context Reasoning, Classification and Semantic Segmentation for detecting missing traffic signs, along with GradCam visuals for better interpretations.
